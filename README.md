# FlavorFusion - React Frontend

This is the frontend for FlavorFusion, a recipe sharing application built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. It connects to a backend generated by Manifest.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up and login functionality.
- **Recipe Discovery**: Browse a dashboard of all public recipes.
- **Recipe Creation**: Logged-in users can create and publish their own recipes, including image uploads.
- **Responsive Design**: A modern, mobile-first UI built with Tailwind CSS.
- **Protected Routes**: User-specific pages like the dashboard are protected and require authentication.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm, pnpm, or yarn
- A running instance of the Manifest-generated backend for FlavorFusion.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following variables. These should point to your Manifest backend.

    ```
    VITE_API_URL=https://your-manifest-backend-url.com/api
    VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://your-manifest-backend-url.com
    ```

    The `APP_ID` is hardcoded in `src/constants.js` to match the `name` in `manifest.yml`.

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.
